## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r library and data load}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

game_reviews <- read.csv("Data/game_reviews.csv")
global_sales <- read.csv("Data/global_sales.csv")
pc_game_sales <- read.csv("Data/pc_game_sales.csv")
twitch_game_data <- read.csv("Data/twitch_game_data.csv")
twitch_global_data <- read.csv("Data/twitch_global_data.csv")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
